Howto create VETH device
========================
The VETH (virtual Ethernet) device is a local Ethernet tunnel.
You can create virtual interfaces using the iproute2 toolkit:
    $ ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1

This will create 2 interfaces, veth0 and veth1. Think of them as 2 ends of a pipe.
Any traffic sent into veth0 will come out veth1 and vice versa.
If you want the traffic to be routed, you can do:

   $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.veth0.forwarding=1

This will tell the kernel to forward traffic coming from veth0 (so use veth1 for the used endpoint).
Another option is to set up a bridge with veth0 and another interface. Then any traffic coming through
the virtual interface will get routed out to the network as if your machine were simply acting as a switch.

To tear it down:
   $ ip link del veth0
